This is an addition to the ant landscape generator that allows you to set the xy origin of the landscape you are creating. 
I created this so I could generate large terrains tile by tile, but I'm sure there are more uses out there.
original ant landscape generator not by me, these are just a few tweaks.

INSTALLING
go to your addons folder, and replace the add_mesh_ant_landscape.py with this one.
