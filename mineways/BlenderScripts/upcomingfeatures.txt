Animated textures (defaults from minecraft, also: grass, leaves, torches)
Clouds (3d and 2d)
Better lighting based on time of day (including background light getting brighter during mid day)
Sprites for sun and moon
Varying lighting intensity for different blocks (for example: torches are darker than glowstone)
Support for different weather types
Builtin fire (Including optional ember particles (both real and minecraft-like (minecraft-like by default)))
Restructure block metadata so it uses 2d array
Lower noise lighting (using invisible light emitters that only show on diffuse rays)
Remove the need for the PREFIX constant to be manual (This -should- be possible) (Automatic prefix detection)
Colored glass uses its color for transparency 

-- For when we have nothing else to do --
toggleable import settings (all default off, unless stated otherwise)
  "Real" fire using inbuilt fire engine
  "Real" tall grass using inbuilt hair engine
  "Real" low grass on grass (dirt) blocks using hair engine
  "Real" Clouds
  "Real" Glass that is physically accurate


-- Suggestions for Mineways that can't realistically be done just with python scripting
Easy importing for Minecraft skins/characters
